## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A855F7), representing creativity and innovation, aligning with the brand's focus on AI-powered tools. Given that we're creating a dark and light theme, it must be suitable for both schemes.
- Background color: A very light desaturated purple (#F2F0FC) to work with the light theme, while the dark theme would be a very dark desaturated purple (#1A1529).
- Accent color: An analogous color to purple will be blue (#55A8F7). Using the inverse saturation and luminosity in each color scheme will yield two useful versions of blue.
- Geometric sans-serif typography for a clean and modern feel. Options include Inter, Satoshi, or Manrope.
- Responsive grid layout that adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Use subtle animated UI transitions with Framer Motion to create a smooth user experience. To maintain performance, avoid animations that cause large repaints, such as full screen transitions.
